# Classification: Detecting Bank note fraud
##### This project is part of a two part assignment developed in light of the Machine Learning course attended at NOVA SST. The first part of this assignment was a Regression Problem related to Asteroid Collision, also avaliable in GitHub through this link: https://github.com/zeca77/Regression-Problem-Collision-avoidance-in-Space

The goal of the assignment was to parametrize, fit and compare Naive Bayes classifiers.The data
set is inspired on the banknote authentication problem in the UCI machine learning repository,
but the data was adapted for this assignment.

<br /> For this we implemented a Naive Bayes classifier using Kernel Density Estimation for the
probability distributions of the feature values. This is the result:
